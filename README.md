# GifterHelper

###A CS 499 Project.
Our backend is using parse : https://www.parse.com/
We are using parse for our database as it is simple and easy to integrate into our project.

For our GUI implementation we are using a mixture of activities and fragments. Our device data storage is using two methods, parse's local data store using pinning as well as shared preferences.
